                                    Hello! I'm Janah Abu Hassan, a student at Georgia Tech, where I'm
                                    concentrating on cybersecurity and robotics and autonomous technology. I've always been fascinated by
                                    these fields because they allow me to tackle complex challenges. <br><br>
                                    
                                    I'm also an aspiring entrepreneur, currently building a startup that aims to change the way international students
                                    choose their colleges. It's all about helping students make informed decisions while giving universities
                                    a chance to expand their global reach. It's an exciting blend of tech, education, and making a positive impact. <br><br>

                                    Speaking of tech, I have honed skills in Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Python, and Django. I have used 
                                    these languages to create several projects, bringing ideas to life and solving real world problems. <br><br>

                                    Beyond tech and entrepreneurship, I enjoy networking and meeting and connecting with like-minded people.
                                    I genuinely enjoy meeting new people, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on meaningful projects. It's through these
                                    interactions that I find inspiration and discover new opportunities for personal and professional growth. <br><br>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="about-me-container-continuation">
                            <div class="description-continuation">
                            In addition to that, self improvement is a core value I hold to a high standard. I enjoy reading books that help me 
                            improve and live better, and journaling my thoughts and ideas. Right now, I am reading "The Daily Stoic", a book about a
                            Greek philosophy called Stoicism, which gives me a whole new perspective on how to live a life in tranquility. <br><br>

                            A quote mentioned in the book that I love is one by Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus : "The impediment to action advances action.
                            What stands in the way becomes the way." This made me go from facing obstacles with fear to facing them with the idea that this 
                            is nothing but a chance for growth and resilience. <br><br>

                            Now that you know enough about me, kick back, explore my website, and dive into my projects, experiences, and dreams. Together,
                            let's embark on an exciting journey of innovation, constant learning, and making a positive impact in the world.
